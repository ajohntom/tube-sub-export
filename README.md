# tube-sub-export
Browser add-on/extension to download YouTube subscription list as an XML, in a fashion it used to work in Subscription Manager.

The Firefox version is live on Mozilla Add-On Gallery: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tube-sub-export/

For Chromium based browsers (Google Chrome, Opera, etc.) download the repo, enable developer mode in the browser"s extension settings an install the extension locally.
(Not a fan of the idea registering a Google Dev Account just for this, and also pay Google for that...).
No harmfull code is present in the extension, you can even have a look at the actual code!

In terms of coding style, well. I know, a lot to be desired... but it works!
